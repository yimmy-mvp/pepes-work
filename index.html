						<h2><a href="#">See Like a Bee</a></h2>
<p class="insight">Not all content is an ad, but all ads are content. Make it useful.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Humans see flowers as decoration. Bees see them as survival. How do we bridge the gap?</p>
					</header>
					<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vnza9eTTSVU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> We turned Instagram into a lens that reveals what bees actually see—helping gardeners plant what truly attracts them.</p>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> 110K+ flower buyers made smarter choices. Less guessing, more buzzing.</p>

						<h2><a href="#">Rediscover Germany</a></h2>
<p class="insight">You don’t need to convince people to love your brand. Show them how it fits into what they already love.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A world stuck at home, dreaming of travel. What if the best trip was already within reach?</p>

					<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-P8TUgfM6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> We showed travelers that every dream destination had a German alternative, just a train ride away.</p>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> Deutsche Bahn climbed +10 points in brand perception and became the travel brand of the moment.</p>

						<h2><a href="#">Tested by the Internet</a></h2>
<p class="insight">People trust what they create more than what they’re told. Give them a way in.</p>
						<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A brand saying its tools are tough isn’t proof. How do we make people believe it?</p>

					<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oikKaTDFu3M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> We let the internet decide. 50K+ people voted on the wildest stress tests for Bosch tools, and we did them live.</p>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> Bosch reached audiences it had never spoken to before, and every test became proof, not just a promise.</p>
