            <!-- Case Study 1 -->
            <section class="panel case-study" id="case1">
                <h2>See Like a Bee</h2>
                <div class="video-container">

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Bees see flowers differently than humans. How can we help gardeners plant the most attractive flowers?</p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>On World Bee Day, we created an Instagram filter simulating the color spectrum visible to bees. Gardeners could switch it on to identify the most attractive colors and help bees find their way to their gardens.</p>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>More than 110K flower buyers used the filter to identify the best colors for bees.</p>

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Summer 2020. A global pandemic disrupts international travel. Millions cancel their plans.</p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>We reminded travelers that they could stay in Germany and get experiences similar to international destinationsâ€”all within a short train ride.</p>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>Deutsche Bahn gained the top place with +10 points on the most popular brand rankings.</p>

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Bosch is Invented for Life, not just for labs. How can they prove to their community that they're ready for life's hardest curveballs?</p>
                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                <p>We let the internet decide how to test our products using Instagram's polling function.</p>
                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>More than 50,000 submissions turned into real-world challenges for our tools, reaching target groups that Bosch had never reached before.</p>
